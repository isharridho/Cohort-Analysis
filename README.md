Cohort analysis is an analysis of user, subscriber or customer behavior that focuses on collecting data from platforms such as EMRS, e-commerce platforms, web applications, or online games to then break them down into groups (units) of analysis.

Cohort Analysis is useful for companies to see behavioral patterns of users, subscribers or customers in the estimated entire customer life cycle (Customer Time Live Value). Cohort Analysis serves to find out whether user engagement is actually getting better over time or just increasing due to growth. Cohort Analysis also serves to separate growth metrics from user engagement metrics.
